#### Version 0.1

tree.tcl will post to your libertree forest.

## INSTALLATION

### GNU/linux, BSD, Mac
**For gnu/linux systems: ** 
Make sure you have tcl/tk 8.5 or newer installed.
You should be able to do this with your distribution's
package manager (apt, yum, pacman, whatever)
Then just run the install.sh script.

**Mac and BSD** 
That will probably work on mac and bsd, too.
Mac users will likely need to install Tcl/Tk first
(if not already installed, which is unlikely).
Get it at http://www.activestate.com/activetcl
I believe BSD users can install it with their distribution's
package manager.

### Windows
Perhaps I'll eventually whip up a starkit (standalone exe file),
but for now, Windows users will need to install Tcl/Tk if they don't have it.
Get it at http://www.activestat.com/activetcl
Then, copy the treetcl.conf file to your home directory 
C:\Users\yourname\
as .treetcl.conf (make sure you put the ., just copy the file over, and rename it).
To be clear, the file will then be C:\Users\yourname\.treetcl.conf
Where "yourname" should be your username on the machine.
Like, for tazman, it would be C:\Users\tazman\.treetcl.conf
(always really gotta spell stuff out for Windows users...pitiable creatures...)
Then you can click on tree.tcl and it will run. You can make a desktop shortcut to it, etc.
